        <strong>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong></a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
    It is often assisted by technologies such as <u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u> and scripting languages such as <u>JavaScript.</u></p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.<br>
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

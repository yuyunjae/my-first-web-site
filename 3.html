    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/introduction/ECMA-and-javascript.php" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification"><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong></a>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
    As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br>
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

    <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.<br>
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br>
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.<br>
    The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br>
    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
